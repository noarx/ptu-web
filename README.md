# ptu-web

## Overview

Web-based tools for [Pokemon Tabletop Unite 1.05](https://pokemontabletop.com/downloads-and-resources/) (kinda).

This web-app is designed to make running and playing PTU easier and more enjoyable by automating some crunch, lookups, and bookkeeping. Note that it is not fully RAW compliant as doing so would be a fool's errand. The product available here reflects a faithful interpretation of the spirit of PTU and of the Pokemon series -- not a true implementation of the rulebooks. 

For insight on the failings of the original rules, see the [official PTU download megadoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nth5gA7WrFzvxfyaNtVaz8_xwUmLu-sysh34dDn3ROM).
